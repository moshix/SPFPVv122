*  See WHATSNOT.DOC for the commands not yet implemented in
   Tritus SPF 1.2.2.

*  See TSPFDM.DOC for an overview of the parts of the Dialog Manager
   that are currently implemented.

*  Sample REXX programs

   TPRNT.REX    - Sample Tritus SPF logical printer REXX program.
                  This program is called to execute the PRINT command
                  when the active logical printer has a REXX program
                  name of TPRNT.

   TPRINT.REX   - Sample Tritus SPF logical printer REXX program that
                  supports all 0.2 panel fields.

   COUNTSTR.SPF - Sample Tritus SPF REXX Edit Macro that counts the
                  number of occurrences of a search string.

*  Utility programs for Tritus SPF

   TPANRLDC.EXE - A family-mode API program to remove PC line-draw
                  characters from Tritus SPF panels.  For help,
                  TPANRLDC ?.

*  Programs provided for problem analysis

   MEMTEST.EXE  - DOS only.
   EMS.COM      -  ''  ''
   XMS.COM      -  ''  ''
   MAPMEM.COM   -  ''  ''
   TSPFDUMP.EXE - A family-mode API program used to format a dump file.

*  Tritus SPF uses the ISPF/PDF defaults for keys PF1-12.  If you
   want to stay with the SPF/PC style mappings for PF1-12, then
   edit TDPFKS12.TXT and change the order of the file to reflect
   the following:

            HELP
            SPLIT
            END
            SWAP
            RFIND
            RCHANGE
            UP
            DOWN
            LEFT
            RIGHT
            RETURN
            CRETRIEV

   The changes will be in effect the next time you start Tritus SPF.

บ   UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES    บ
ศออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

*  FLIP is an edit primary command and edit macro command that
   reverses the excluded status of data lines and special lines.

      FLIP [range]

      range   Two labels that show which lines are to be flipped.
              If omitted, the entire file is reversed.

      ISREDIT FLIP [lptr-range]

      lptr-range   Two line pointers that specify the range of lines
                   to be flipped.  A line pointer can be a label or
                   a relative line number.  If omitted, the entire
                   file is reversed.

*  An ATTR column was added to file lists.  If any file in the list
   has the read-only or hidden or system attribute, the column will
   appear.  You can set attributes by using the I line command on
   panel 3.4.

*  UPPERCASE FILENAMES field was added to panel 0.4 to allow
   translation of filenames to uppercase.

*  RAM 00,FF VISIBLE field was added to panel 0.4 to make RAM font
   code points 00 and FF viewable.

*  DEFAULT CPQ NAME field was added to panel 0.4 to set the default
   cut/paste queue name.

*  Find/Change Type field was moved from panel 0.4 to edit profiles
   (panel 0.6).  From edit, issue PROFILE PANEL to go directly to
   the current edit profile if you want to change case sensitivity
   dynamically while in edit.  Press F3 (END) to return to edit.

*  VIEW is a new general command as well as Option V on the Primary
   Option Menu.  It is also a /V command line option.

   Differences between VIEW and EDIT are as follows:

      - File must exist for VIEW.
      - If file has zero records, EDIT fills the screen with temp
        lines whereas VIEW does not.
      - VIEW is like BROWSE in regards to file sharing.
      - SAVE is not a valid command in VIEW, neither as an edit primary
        command nor as an edit macro command.
      - END will always end without saving the file in VIEW.

*  Ctrl_Break will immediately interrupt FIND, CHANGE, EXCLUDE, file
   load including COPY/MOVE, file save including SAVE and
   CREATE/REPLACE.  A message is issued and Tritus SPF is still
   operational.

   In addition, Ctrl_Break will interrupt an XWAIT status if you
   issue Ctrl_Break five times (ascending tones).  Tritus SPF is
   aborted and any file being edited is not saved.  This would only
   be useful in the case that the code was looping.

*  OIA xxxxK memory available in DOS was changed to unlocked available
   memory from largest contiguous memory block.  OS/2 and PharLap still
   use the largest contiguous memory block.

*  TRITUS SPF VERSION, MEMORY STATE, and MAXIMUM LRECL fields were
   added to panel 5.  The MAXIMUM LRECL is a recommended maximum
   based on memory available.

*  The RETRIEVE command has a limit of 100 items on the queue.

*  The STACK command has a limit of 40.

*  REXX programs have a size limit of 32000 bytes.

*  Operating system commands in REXX programs and screen output.

   Tritus SPF cannot know ahead of time if a DOS or OS/2 command
   intends to write to the screen.  If your program displays no
   output to the screen, then a REXX SAY statement is not needed.

   When the first SAY statement in any REXX program is executed,
   Tritus SPF erases the screen and displays the name of the REXX
   program.  Any output from REXX SAY statements and DOS or OS/2
   commands will be viewable.  When the REXX program ends,
   Tritus SPF will display a message to press any key to continue,
   then the normal Tritus SPF full screen display will reappear.

   For example, from a REXX program issue a DIR command:

                SAY
                ADDRESS CMD dir

   If a DOS REXX program calls an operating system command or program
   and you receive an 'out of memory' message, switch from TSPF to
   TSPFP to make available the maximum amount of conventional memory.

*  COLUMNS is a valid edit primary command.  RESET SPECIAL or RESET
   erases the COLUMNS header line in edit.

*  Message lines are issued when total memory capacity is greater than
   total page space capacity.  This can lead to diminished performance
   due to excessive paging.  This usually means your hard disk is
   nearly full.  Providing more free space for paging will eliminate
   the message.
