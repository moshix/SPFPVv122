# SPF/PC version 1.2.2

This is one of the first versions of SPF / PC, from 199, but Tritus Inc. This software is now abandonware. 

To execute panels commands (e.g. for navigation) press the key (e.g 2) and Control at the same time

Works fine in DOSBOX, FREEDOS, real MS-DOS etc. . 

No support whatsoever from me. You're on your own.
