TRITUS SPF DIALOG MANAGER - FEB 08, 1993

   This file is provided for users that are familiar with the
   mainframe Dialog Manager and want to tinker with the Dialog
   Manager in Tritus SPF.

   The mainframe Dialog Manager is complicated.  This document does
   not attempt to explain the concepts of the Dialog Manager,
   but rather the parts of it that are currently implemented.

   The files mentioned in this document are in the file TPANEL12.PDS.
   Use the TPDS utility to extract the files for your inspection.

   Feel free to experiment and change panels, but please, don't
   remove the Tritus copyright message from the Primary Panel.

DIALOG MANAGER POOL VARIABLE NAMES
   Dialog manager pool variables that contain an underscore can be
   used on panels as long as the underscore is not itself used as
   an attribute byte.  Since the default characters include the
   underscore character, use the DEFAULT keyword on the )ATTR or )BODY
   statement to change the default characters to exclude the underscore
   character.

DIALOG MANAGER READ-ONLY VARIABLES
   Documentation improved.

DIALOG MANAGER WRITE-VALIDATION VARIABLES
   New with this shipment.

)ATTR SECTION NEW KEYWORDS
   FIRSTPOS and MAXLEN.

BUGS FIXED
   New )ATTR attributes used to redefine the default attributes were
   not handled correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New with Ship 3 -

BUGS FIXED
   SKIP (ON) was not working.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New with Ship 4 -

)BODY has a new keyword, COLOR(YES)
The COLOR keyword in the )ATTR section now supports the mainframe
colors PINK and TURQUOISE.
Now attributes that contain the COLOR() keyword are ignored if the
terminal does not support color.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dialog manager variable pools.

PROFILE POOL

   File TSPFIPRF.VP in the PDS contains the initial set of profile
   pool variables.
   File TUPROF12.VP in the TSPF directory contains the current profile
   pool variables when Tritus SPF is brought down except for non-default
   key definitions which are stored in TUKEYS12.VP.
   There is one profile pool for Tritus SPF.

SHARED POOL

   File TSPFISHR.VP in the PDS contains the initial set of shared
   pool variables.
   There is one shared pool for each side of a split screen.  This
   pool is used to communicate from one panel to another.
   When a screen is split, the new session inherits a copy of the
   shared pool from the other side of the split screen.

FUNCTION POOL

   Each panel has its own function pool that contain variables which
   correspond to the various visible screen fields for the panel.

Names of variables -

   The characters allowed in a variable name are alphabetic,
   numeric, and the underscore character.  The DEFAULT statement must
   be used on the panel definition if a variable name containing an
   underscore character is defined in the panel.

Memory manager variables -

   All variables that start with ZMM are internally controlled by the
   Tritus Memory Manager.  These are set in the 0.7 panel and sub-
   panels and are stored in the TMEMGR12.BIN file since these values
   are required early in initialization.

Read only variables -

   There are a number of dialog manager read-only variables, e.g.
   ZTIME is the current time.  These are all currently in the shared
   pool and are defined in the file TSPFISHR.VP by ordinal.

Write validation variables -

   There are a number of dialog manager variables that require
   validation or immediate action when the variable is to be written.
   These are all currently in the profile pool and are defined in
   the file TSPFIPRF.VP by ordinal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Files that define panels have the suffix PAN.

The primary options menu is defined in the variable ZISPPRIM.
As distributed, it is TSPFPRIM.

Panel syntax supported -

)ATTR DEFAULT(xxx)

   The three default attributes are
      %  TYPE( TEXT ) SKIP( OFF ) CAPS( OFF ) INTENS( HIGH )
      +  TYPE( TEXT ) SKIP( OFF ) CAPS( OFF ) INTENS( LOW )
      _  TYPE( INPUT ) CAPS( ON ) INTENS( HIGH )

   Attributes as defined in )ATTR and the default attributes are
   recognized.  Using the name Z with ZVARS in the INIT proc is
   supported, see panel TSPF08.PAN and program TSPF08I.PRX for an
   example.

  attr  TYPE( INPUT OUTPUT TEXT )
        SKIP( ON OFF )
        CAPS( IN OFF ON OUT )
        INTENS( HIGH LOW MEDIUM NON )
        COLOR( DARKBLUE DARKGREEN DARKCYAN DARKRED DARKMAGENTA BROWN
               DARKWHITE GRAY BLUE GREEN CYAN RED MAGENTA YELLOW WHITE
               PINK TURQ TURQUOISE )
           The names PINK and TURQUOISE (with it's alias TURQ) are
           included for the many mainframe panel definitions that
           contain them.  On the PC, PINK will appear as MAGENTA and
           TURQUOISE will appear as CYAN.  The other five mainframe
           colors are already included in the set of fifteen PC colors.
           The COLOR keyword is ignored if the terminal does not
           support color.  This can be overridded by the COLOR(YES)
           keyword on the )BODY statement.  See panel 0.5 for an
           example.
        FIRSTPOS( DATA ATTR )
           This is a Tritus SPF addition.  The default is FIRSTPOS(ATTR).
           FIRSTPOS(DATA) indicates that the first position of the field
           can be used as data, making it unnecessary for the attribute
           byte to consume a position on the screen.  This technique can
           be used to have fields with different attributes next to each
           other without an intervening space.
        MAXLEN( nnn )
           This is a Tritus SPF addition.  It is only valid for
           TYPE(INPUT).  When selected, the field becomes an unprotected
           scroll field for the indicated length.  When typing at the
           end of the field, the whole field is shifted.  All of the
           Keyboard panels (0.3) use this keyword with a length of 300
           to allow for 300 characters to be used for key mapping.

)BODY DEFAULT(xxx) EXPAND(xx) COLOR(YES)

   The three default attributes are
      %  TYPE( TEXT ) SKIP( OFF ) CAPS( OFF ) INTENS( HIGH )
      +  TYPE( TEXT ) SKIP( OFF ) CAPS( OFF ) INTENS( LOW )
      _  TYPE( INPUT ) CAPS( ON ) INTENS( HIGH )

   Attributes as defined in )ATTR and the default attributes are
   recognized.  Using the name Z with ZVARS in the INIT proc is
   supported, see panel TSPF08.PAN and program TSPF08I.PRX for an
   example.

   The COLOR(YES) keyword informs the dialog manager that there
   are attributes defined with colors, and the color requests are
   to be honored even if the terminal does not support color.

)INIT xxxxxxxx
)REINIT xxxxxxxx
)PROC xxxxxxxx

   xxxxxxxx.PRX is the name of the REXX program that drives the
   panel.  Currently, the REINIT program is ignored.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

REXX programs that drive the panels have a suffix of PRX.

ADDRESS ISPEXEC environment commands:
   VPUT varname
   VGET varname
   LPRTGET DataLine

   VPUT and VGET are used to copy between REXX variables and the
   Dialog Manager variable pools.

   LPRTGET gets the contents of the next print line and puts it in
   the variable DataLine.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tritus SPF Dialog Manager will be evolving rapidly in the next
several months.  Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
